Thanks for you pull request, do note the following:

- If your PR introduces backward incompatible changes it will very likely not be merged.

- We support the last two major Go versions, if your PR uses features from a too new Go version, it
  will not be merged.

- If this text is not replaced (deleted, or preferably replaced with something sensible), your PR will be closed.
